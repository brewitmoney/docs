Brewit uses ERC-4337 infra and tools to create and send transactions as user operations.

### User Operation creation

User operation is created for send and swap operations based on the user's intent.

For swap operations, we make use of 0x API to get the best route and quote.

### User Operation Signing

User operation is signed by signer of the smart account based on the authentication method.

### User Operation propagation

User operations collect relevant information uncluding paymaster to sponsor the transactions fee and then send to the bundler.

We make use of Pimlico Paymaster and Bundler to propagate the user operations.
