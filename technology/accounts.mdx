## Account Creation

Brewit accounts are implemented as Safe Accounts (formerly Gnosis Safe) that comply with ERC-4337 Account Abstraction and ERC-7579 specifications. This implementation provides:
- Full compatibility with ERC-4337 infrastructure
- Enhanced security through modular validation
- Flexible authentication mechanisms

### Technical Implementation

Each Brewit account is deployed as an ERC-7579-enabled Safe Account with the following configuration:

```json
{
"owners": ["authenticatedSigner"], // Single owner based on auth method
"version": "1.4.1",
"entryPoint": "0x5FF137D4b0FDCD49DcA30c7CF57E578a026d2789", // EntryPoint v0.7
"validators": [
], // Based on auth method
"executors": [],
"attesters": [
"RHINESTONE_ATTESTER", // is the address of the Rhinestone attester
"ZENGUARD_ATTESTER" // is the address of the Zenguard attester
],
"attestersThreshold": 1, // Number of attesters required for module attestation
"safe4337ModuleAddress": "SAFE_7579_ADAPTER", // is the address of the Safe 7579 adapter module
"erc7579LaunchpadAddress": "ERC7579_LAUNCHPAD", // is the address of the ERC7579 Launchpad contract
"safeSingletonAddress": SAFE_SINGLETON // is the address of the Safe Singleton contract
}
```

This configuration could be used to generate a Safe Account using library like [permissionless.js](https://docs.pimlico.io/permissionless/how-to/accounts/use-safe-account)

## Authentication Methods

Brewit supports multiple authentication strategies, each implemented with specific security considerations:

### 1. Dynamic Embedded Wallet Authentication
**Use cases**: Email and Social logins (Google, Twitter, Farcaster)

Technical implementation:
- Utilizes [Dynamic Embedded Wallets](https://docs.dynamic.xyz/wallets/embedded-wallets/dynamic-embedded-wallets)
- Wallet is added as both owner and validator of the Safe Account
- Currently uses Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) for key management
- Planned migration to Threshold Signature Scheme (TSS-MPC) for enhanced security

<Note>
Dynamic Embedded Wallets uses TEE for key management and signing but soon will be ported to TSS-MPC for better security.
</Note>

### 2. WebAuthn Passkey Authentication
**Implementation details**:
- Integrates Rhinestone-attested WebAuthn module
- Compatible with ERC-7579 specification
- Originally developed by ZeroDev for Kernel Accounts
- Custom passkey service for additional platform authentication

<Note>
We run our own Passkey service to also authenticate the user for various other services.
</Note>

### 3. External Wallet Authentication
**Features**:
- Direct integration with existing crypto wallets
- Wallet becomes primary signer and validator
- Supports all major Web3 wallet providers
- Compatible with both EOA and smart contract wallets
