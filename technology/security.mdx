# Account Security Architecture

Your Brewit account is secured by a rock-solid Safe smart account â€” trusted across the crypto ecosystem.

## Smart Account Implementation

Every Brewit account uses:
- Safe smart account version 1.4.1
- Account abstraction functionality via:
  - ERC-4337 adapter
  - ERC-7579 adapter

## Account Initialization

The account initialization process varies based on the authentication method:

### Embedded Wallet or Crypto Wallet
- Safe account is initialized with the wallet owner
- Threshold is set to 1

### Passkey Authentication
- Safe account is initialized with a burner address (`0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dead`)
- Threshold is set to 1

## Safe Account Interoperability

The deployed Safe account is compatible with other Safe-compatible wallets and services. However:

- By default, Safe accounts use an embedded wallet as owner
- This default configuration is not compatible with other Safe-compatible wallets and services

### Customizing Compatibility

Users can enhance compatibility by:
- Changing the owner address
- Converting to a multisig account
- Configuring settings in the Security section

<Note>
SDK support for these configurations will be available in future releases.
