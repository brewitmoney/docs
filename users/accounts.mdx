### Supported Account Types

Brewit lets you set up permissioned accounts tailored to different use cases. Here are the supported types:

1. **Full Access (Sudo)**
   - Grant full access to specific tokens on each chain.
   - Choose between *swap* or *spend* permissions — with no limits — per token.
   - Brewit displays all tokens with a balance for easy selection.

2. **Limited Access**
   - Set spending limits on a per-token basis.  
     _Example: Allow 5 USDC out of 100 USDC from your main account._

### Supported Authentication Methods

Choose from a range of authentication options depending on your needs. Brewit currently supports:

- **Email Address**
  - Add and verify an email to grant access — even to new users.  
    _Ideal for onboarding friends or family._

- **Passkey**
  - Use an existing or new passkey stored on your phone.  
    _Great for managing your main account with permissioned access across devices._

- **Existing Brewit User**
  - Grant access to any existing Brewit user by entering their address or scanning their QR code.

Once an account is created, you can **track**, **edit**, or **remove** it from your main account — and access it anytime using the chosen authentication method.
